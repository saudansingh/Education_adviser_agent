# LiveKit Voice Agent Workshop

Welcome to the Voice Agent Workshop! In this workshop, you will learn how to build and test a production-ready voice agent using [LiveKit](https://livekit.io) and [Coval](https://coval.dev).

## Prerequisites

To run this agent, you need the following

- A [LiveKit Cloud](https://cloud.livekit.io) account, project, and API keys
- A Python environment with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) installed
- An [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com) account and API Key
- A [Deepgram](https://www.deepgram.com) account and API Key

## Setup

Step 1: Copy this repository (Click the green "Use this template" button on GitHub)
Step 2: Clone your new copy to your local machine
Step 3: Install dependencies using uv

    ```shell
    uv sync
    ```

Step 4: Create a `.env.local` file in the root of the project and add your API keys

    ```
    LIVEKIT_URL=
    LIVEKIT_API_KEY=
    LIVEKIT_API_SECRET=
    OPENAI_API_KEY=
    DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=
    ```

You can load the LiveKit environment automatically using the [LiveKit CLI](https://docs.livekit.io/home/cli/cli-setup):

```bash
lk cloud auth
lk app env -w -d .env.local
```

Step 5: Run your new agent in the console

    ```shell
    uv run agent.py console
    ```

## Web frontend

This agent is compatible with the [LiveKit Agents Playground](https://agents-playground.livekit.io).

To run the agent for the playground, use the `dev` subcomand:

    ```shell
    uv run agent.py dev
    ```

## Development instructions

In this workshop, you will be adding features and functionality to the `agent.py` file. You are free to use the playground or the console mode to speak with your agent as you work on it.

## Testing with Coval

For the Coval sections of the workshop, you need to run your agent in `dev` mode to make it available to Coval.

    ```shell
    uv run agent.py dev
    ```

To setup the Coval connection, follow these steps:

1. Enable the token server from your project's **Options** on the [Settings](https://cloud.livekit.io/projects/p_/settings/project) page in LiveKit Cloud.
2. Copy the `sandboxId` & `sandboxUrl` displayed below the toggle.
3. Sign in to your [Coval](https://www.coval.dev/) account (you should have an email invite already)
4. Click the "Agents" menu item in the top left
5. Click the "Connect Agent" button in the top right
6. Enter a name for your agent
7. Select "LiveKit" as the simulator type
8. For token endpoint, use `https://cloud-api.livekit.io/api/sandbox/connection-details`
9. For the token sandbox id, use the `sandboxId`
10. Add your LiveKit server URL (it's in your `.env.local` file)
11. Set content type to `application/json`

You should now be ready to test your agent in Coval.

## Post-workshop
